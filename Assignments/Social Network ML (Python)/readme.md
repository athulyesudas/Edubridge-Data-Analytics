## Social Network ML using Scikit Learn

### Objective:
 - This assignment is done for learning ML with different libraries in Scikit Learn and for comparing each outcomes.

### Result:

 Prediction Accuracy

  - Logistic Regression - 60 to 70 %  (random state 63 %)

 - DecisionTree Classifier - 75 to 85 %  (random state 78 %)

 - RandomForest Classifier - 85 to 95 %  (random state 85 %)
 
 - KNeighbours Classifier - 70 to 80 %  (random state 75 %)

 - SVC - 70 to 80 %  (random state 70 %)

### Conclusion:

 - From this observation Random forest has the highest accuracy and Logistic Regression has the least accuracy.
