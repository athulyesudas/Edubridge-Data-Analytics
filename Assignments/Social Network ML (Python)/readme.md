## Social Network ML using Scikit Learn

### Objective:
 - This assignment is done for learning ML with different libraries in Scikit Learn and for comparing each outcomes.

### Result:

 Prediction Accuracy

 - Logistic Regression - 60 to 70 % (fluctuates with each run)

 - DecisionTree Classifier - 98 to 100 % (fluctuates with each run)

 - RandomForest Classifier - 100% (no fluctuations)
 
 - KNeighbours Classifier - 85 to 95 % (fluctuates with each run)

### Conclusion:

 - From this observation Random forest has the highest accuracy and Logistic Regression has the least accuracy.
